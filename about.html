    <p>Sterling spent four years with local youth team Alpha & Omega before signing for Queens Park Rangers,
      at age 10, as a winger. Sterling was subsequently scouted by the academies of Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham,
      Liverpool and Manchester City. However, he was encouraged by his mother not to choose clubs in the locality
      in order to escape the hostile gang culture in London.</p>
    <p>Sterling was signed by Liverpool from the academy at Queens Park Rangers in February 2010 by then academy director
       Frank McParland and Rafael Benítez, for an initial fee of £450,000, with the possibility of rising up to £2 million depending
       on how many appearances he made for the first team. He initially played in the club's youth team, making his debut in
       an Under-18s derby match against Everton. Sterling scored his first goal for Liverpool in a friendly match against
       Hibernian, which ended in a 2–2 draw. His first Premier Academy League match was a 2–2 draw against Aston Villa, with his
       first win coming at home to Bristol City a week later. On 15 December, he scored in the FA Youth Cup in a 4–0 win over
       Notts County. On 14 February 2011, Sterling scored five goals in a 9–0 win over Southend United. On 24 March 2012, Sterling
       made his senior Liverpool debut as a substitute in a league match against Wigan Athletic, aged 17 years and 107 days,
       becoming the third-youngest player to play for the club. He made two more appearances over the remainder of the
       campaign, again as a substitute</p>
